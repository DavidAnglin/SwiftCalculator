# swiftCalculator
Used auto layout to create the layout of the calculator. 
Added numbers 0-9, square root, +, -, *, /, sin, and cos operations. Along with a clear button.
Created an enum with the kind of operands and operations the calculator could do, ex. operand, unaryOperation, binaryOperation
The calculator was used like a scientific calculator, in which you typed a number, hit enter, hit another number then the operation.
Through this the operands would get added to an array, and the operation would evaluate the last 2 numbers of the array, or the last one
depending on the operation. 
The clear button just called the array and removed all from the array.
